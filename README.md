# Description
This project is a simple web application for spam detection, which I completed as part of a tutorial on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and web development with Streamlit. The app allows users to input a text message, and it predicts whether the message is spam or not based on a pre-trained NLP model.

I completed the project using guided tutorial. It helped me start building projects as a beginner.
